Microcontrollers Programming and Interface  
Repository by ak26009  

Purpose  
This repo collects practical C code examples and interface projects centered on microcontroller programming and peripheral interfacing. 
Hands-on work with GPIOs, interrupts, PWM, UART, I2C/SPI devices and display modules.

Repository Structure  
- `BIT Manipulations/` — Code illustrating bit-wise operations and register level control.  
- `GPIO/` — Examples of configuring and using General Purpose I/O pins on a microcontroller.  
- `Interrupt/` — Demonstrations of external and internal interrupts, ISRs, and event-driven programming.  
- `OLED/` — Projects that use OLED displays for output and graphics with microcontrollers.  
- `UART-ESP8266/` — Serial communication examples, including interfacing with the ESP8266 WiFi module.  
- `UART/` — Basic UART communication examples between microcontrollers or PC.  
- `pwm.c` — Sample code for Pulse Width Modulation: motor control, LED dimming etc.  
- `rtc.c` — Real Time Clock interfacing example.
